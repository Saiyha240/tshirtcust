                <p>At T-shirt Creations, we strive to ensure that goods ordered through
                  the Service are always accurate and of the highest quality.</p>
                  <p>Time of payment - Due to the extensive amount of work required prior to the printing and shipping of your order
                  (e.g. artwork preparation), you will be charged at the time your order is placed. </p>
                  <p>Cancellations after printing has begun. Because of the customized nature of these goods,
                  we do not allow cancellations once we begin printing an order.
                   Orders enter the printing process as early as one business day after they are placed on our website.</p>
                  <p>Cancellations before printing has begun. We allow cancellations on orders that (i) have been processed
        but (ii) have not yet begun the printing process. Cancellations in this phase are subject to a fifteen percent (15%) cancellation
  fee of the order total. (This cancellation fee covers costs associated with preparing for an order, including artwork processing,
  prepress processing, and material preparation costs.) Orders are processed as early as minutes after
  they are placed on our website, and enter the printing process as early as one business day after they are placed on our website. ?</p>
  <p> Refunds and exchanges. We do not accept refunds or make exchanges after an order has been printed and/or shipped.
     If, upon receipt of your finished merchandise, you feel that your order was incorrect due to an error on our part,
    please submit a claim to http://www.T-shirt Creations/claims within 14 days of your delivery date. Claims are handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>




<p><p> <p><p>OVER/UNDER RUNS:
Orders are subject to overruns and/or under runs due to the nature of the printing process.
Generally if we have over runs and you will receive a few extra shirts free of charge.
In some cases an under run in a certain size will occur and the over run in other sizes will cover that amount (i.e.: you order 25 smalls and 25 mediums,
you may receive 24 smalls and 26 mediums). It there are misprints of any kind we will adjust your bill. If your bill is finalized,
then the credit will be held and used on your next order.</p></p></p></p>
